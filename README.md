# Weirdcord's Official Webring!

Come visit [here](https://weirdring.netlify.app/)!

Our community webring is dedicated to the genre of Weirdcore. This eclectic and quirky style of music and art is characterized by its unconventional, eclectic, and often bizarre qualities. If you're a fan of the strange and unusual, this is the webring for you!

A webring is a network of websites linked together in a circular structure, creating a collective community with a shared interest. Webrings were popular in the early days of the internet as a way for people to navigate and discover related websites.

## Requirements:

- Your site must include some weirdcore/webcore elements to qualify.
- All weirdcord server rules also apply here, ESPECIALLY NSFW CONTENT!
- No hate speech or bigotry.
- No being advertisement-focused. 

*It is impossible to enumerate everything that is not allowed. For this reason, we (the webmasters) reserve the right to remove a site if we feel it is outside of our own personal bounds.*

## Adding yourself to the members list:

Add a unique slug, your webpage's name, and your webpage's URL to the members list on GitHub in a pull request.
Pull requests can also be used to change your existing entry or delete your entry.

If you're editing your existing entry, make sure to use the same slug. If you're deleting your existing entry, leave the URL field blank.

## Add links on your webpage:

Once you're on the members list, add links on your webpage to http://localhost:4000/YOUR-SLUG/next and http://localhost:4000/YOUR-SLUG/previous, replacing YOUR-SLUG with the slug you chose.
Feel free to include a link to http://localhost:4000/ as well.
