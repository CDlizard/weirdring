<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Your site must include some weirdcore/webcore elements to qualify.
    <li>All weirdcord server rules also apply here, ESPECIALLY NSFW CONTENT!
    <li>No hate speech or bigotry.
    <li>No being advertisement-focused.
</ul>

<small>It is impossible to enumerate everything that is not allowed. For this reason, we (the webmasters) reserve the
    right to remove a site if we feel it is outside of our own personal bounds.</small>

<h2>Add yourself to the members list</h2>
<p>Add a unique slug, your webpage's name, and your webpage's URL to <a
        href={{site.github_repo_url}}/blob/main/_data/members.csv>the members list on GitHub</a> in a pull request.<br>
        Pull requests can also be used to change your existing entry or delete your entry.</p>

<details>
    <summary>If you don't have a GitHub account, fill out this form instead:</summary>
    <form name=signup method=POST data-netlify=true netlify-honeypot=bot>
        <div hidden><label>Leave this blank unless you're spam <input name=bot></label></div>
        <label>Slug <input name=slug pattern=[0-9a-z](?:-?[0-9a-z])* required></label>
        (ASCII lowercase letters, digits, and hyphen-minuses)<br>
        <label>Name <textarea name=name></textarea></label><br>
        <label>URL <input name=url type=url></label><br>
        <label>E-mail address <input type=email name=email required></label><br>You'll receive an e-mail when your
        addition/change is made.<br>
        <input type=submit>
    </form>
    If you're editing your existing entry, make sure to use the same slug. If you're deleting your existing entry, leave
    the URL field blank.
</details>

<h2>Add links on your webpage</h2>
<p>Once you're on the members list, add links on your webpage to <b>{{'/YOUR-SLUG/next'|absolute_url}}</b> and
    <b>{{'/YOUR-SLUG/previous'|absolute_url}}</b>, replacing <b>YOUR-SLUG</b> with the slug you chose.<br>
    Feel free to include a link to <b>{{'/'|absolute_url}}</b> as well.<br>
    Check if <a href=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/sections.html#the-aside-element>the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>
        element</a> is right for you.
